Setting the alarm clock

Wecker has two separate alarms which can be set to wake
you to either the mp3/radio, Sound Soother or a buzzer alarm. In the
event of a power interruption your radio has built in memory that
will retain your alarm settings (config.json). 

Wecker uses your system time as the reference for the alarm
settings.
